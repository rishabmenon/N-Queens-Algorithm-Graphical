# Graphical Implementation of N-Queens Algorithm

In this project, N-queens algorithm is implemented graphically. N queens must be placed
on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. Thus, a solution requires that
no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Backtracking technique is used to place queens in each row at right place.
Backtracking constructs candidate solutions one component at a time and evaluates the partially
constructed solutions. This approach makes it possible to solve some large instances of difficult
combinatorial problems, though, in the worst case, we still face the same curse of exponential
explosion encountered in exhaustive search.

The primary objective of this project is to graphically show the concept of backtracking with the
help of the N-queen puzzle as an example.

Transformations in the project:

• Scaling:
When the Queen moves from one cell to another it is in the shape of a small
square and when it reaches any appropriate cell ,it scales up to a larger sphere.

• Translation:
The Queen moves in horizontal direction, from left to right until it reaches
an appropriate cell.

# Note

This project uses OpenGL software interface. Simple 
techniques like rotation, transformation, motion, lighting, etc have been used.

OpenGL is a software interface to graphics hardware. This interface consists of
about 150 distinct commands that are used to specify the objects and operations needed
to produce interactive applications.
